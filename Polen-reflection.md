1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with the concept and importance of branches. Specifically, I had accidentally made changes on a master branch and could not figure out how to fix that short of deleting and re-adding my repository. I also struggled with pushes and pulls and how they worked because I didn't understand what the term "origin" really meant and how everything worked together.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I definitely clarified the above concepts. We discussed (1) branches and why we create separate ones; (2) what "origin" means and how to make/use new remotes; (3) some simple but helpful command cues (i.e. arrows access previous commands); (4) how to comment on pull requests in GitHub and how that would work during collaboration.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair about if she had trouble with some of the same things I did, like branching (master vs. feature), if she had time to submit feedback feedback, and if she had any command line tricks.

I asked the guide a few questions as we coded: again, about branches, and also about why there are certain stages of git. I didn't at first understand why you would have to go from untracked > staged > commmit, but I now understand why each phase is important.

4. What still confuses you about git?

I'm still not clear on how git will look when working on multiple files. It's hard for me to picture how I will be able to keep everything straight.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was really positive. Part of that may be because my partner and guide were so great. I also felt like my partner and I had the same knowledge, so we were each clarifying and learning along with each other. I do see how it can be difficult to work with someone over a computer -- internet lags, etc. -- but I think with screenshare, confusion is easily eluciated.
