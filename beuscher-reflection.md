#Nicola's Release 7: Reflect

* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Some things that were lingering in my mind after Week 1 were: how frequently to commit, why you would commit files together or not, and when to pull and when to fetch.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Our guide clarified git history and taught us how to use bang (!) which allows you to quickly retrieve and reuse previous commands.
  * We clarified for what specific purposes you would want to edit the master branch or make new branch. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I asked our guide about the command git remote -v so we now understand that repos can be pushed or pulled to different places (other than GitHub) and that "origin" is more like a keyword than a hard-fast location. 
  * I asked my pair about keyboard shortcuts and about using git fetch origin master and git merge origin/master. 

* What still confuses you about git?
  * It's not so much a confusion, but I guess I am still struggling with branching out and using different commands. One tiny thing that I can look up is that I need to solidify the differences between git pull and git fetch. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * Great! I learned a lot from my guide and pair. It requires a lot of attention and focus to talk with people via a computer screen so I do feel a bit exhausted. We also spent an extra hour over the time limit finishing the challenge, so I was thankful we were both available to do so as it made working at our own pace easier.
